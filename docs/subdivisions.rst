In Maya, this is the <3> key. In Blender, it's the Subdivisions modifier. If you used Silo before, that will be <C> and <V>. For my config, I am adopting Silo's style.

******************************
Subdivision Level <\`+1/2/3/4>
******************************

Nvil use <\`> primarily for subdivision operations. Default hotkey to toggle subdivision is <\`>, <Alt+`> for collapsing subdivision and <\`+1/2/3/4> to set the subdivision levels.

For my config, since I am used to Silo style, I just use <C> and <V> all the time. In Maya, we can use <3> to toggle subdivision and use <Page Up> <Page Down> to increase or decrease subdivision levels. Having a toggle key is a common approach and I think it is fine. I definitely use <3> inside Maya all the time. But I don't use toggle in Nvil because <C> and <V> alone are fast enough. I just <C> <C> <V> <V> all the way, the keys are also very close to ASDF, so I can execute them almost in an instant.

Subdivision level cap
=====================

In the gif above, I press <C> four times at the beginning, but the fourth press doesn't increase the level any further because the level has been capped to 3 in Preference -> General -> Subdivision increment cap level.

****************************
Collapse Subdivision <Alt+`>
****************************

Collapse Subdivisions

.. note::
	Default Nvil hotkey for this: <Alt+`>

***********************************
Increase/Decrease Subdivision <C/V>
***********************************

Increase and Decrease Subdivision

.. note::
	Rationale behind using <C/V> key: I have set the subdivision operations to behave like Silo for my config. (I hope you have even heard of this software, it used to be a really nice modeling application, until development seems to stalled for years).

.. note::
	Default Nvil hotkey for this: <None>
