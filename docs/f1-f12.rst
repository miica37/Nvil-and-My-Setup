Open the Preference Window.

.. note::
	Rationale behind using <F1> key: Isn't <F1> key being widely used for Help? I find that I almost never rely on that hotkey on any applications though.. That doesn't mean I didn't use Nvil's Help, I did opened up the Nvil 1.0 Help manual sometimes, but I prefer to access it through the Menu. IMO hotkeys should be reserved for things that we use frequently.

.. note::
	Default Nvil hotkey for this: <None>

***************************
Mini/Maximize Viewport <F2>
***************************

Toggle Single and Quad View. I rarely ever use quad view. I find that Nvil Snap View function is much more intuitive if I ever need to work on the different orthographics view. Check out :ref:`Snap View <snap_view>`.

.. note::
	Rationale behind using <F2> key: Hmm... it's been a long time ago since I switch to use this hotkey and I have totally forgot why I use <F2> unfortunately...
